Imperfect estimation of Lepeophtheirus salmonis abundance and its impact on salmon lice treatment on Atlantic salmon farms

I provide the R code files, which were used in the study of 'Imperfect estimation of Lepeophtheirus salmonis abundance and its impact on salmon lice treatment on Atlantic salmon farms'. 

The R code files can generate the figures in the paper. The necessary packages to run the codes are 'deSolve', 'MESS', and 'sqldf'. The code files should be using 'functions.R' file. Thus, you first need to specify the your own directory with the function of 'setwd' in order to regenerate the simulation.
